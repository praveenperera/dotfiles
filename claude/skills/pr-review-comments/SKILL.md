# PR Review Comments

This skill fetches GitHub pull request review comments using the `prc` CLI tool and loads them as context to help address reviewer feedback.

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user:
- Asks to review PR comments or feedback
- Wants to address reviewer comments
- Needs context about what reviewers said
- Mentions working on PR revisions or fixes
- Provides a GitHub PR URL or references a specific PR number

## How to Use

### Basic Usage

The `prc` CLI accepts three formats:

```bash
# just PR number (auto-detects repo from git remote when in a git repo)
prc 123 --compact

# full PR URL
prc https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123 --compact

# repo and PR number
prc owner/repo 123 --compact
```

Always use `--compact` flag for cleaner output that focuses on essential information (author, comment body, and code references).

### Handling Too Many Comments

If the PR has many comments or the comments seem unhelpful for the review task:
1. Use the `--code-only` flag to filter only comments with code references
2. This reduces noise and focuses on comments about specific code locations

```bash
prc owner/repo 123 --compact --code-only
```

### Example Workflow

1. User provides PR URL or mentions PR number
2. Run `prc` with the PR information and `--compact` flag
   - if in a git repo, just use: `prc 123 --compact`
   - otherwise use full URL or owner/repo format
3. Review the comments to understand reviewer feedback
4. If too many comments or not useful, re-run with `--code-only`
5. Use the context to make appropriate code changes

## Output Format

The compact format includes:
- **Author**: Who wrote the comment
- **Comment body**: The actual feedback
- **Code reference**: File and line numbers where applicable

This provides sufficient context while minimizing token usage.

## Notes

- no `--token` flag needed (GitHub CLI token is already configured globally)
- comments are ordered chronologically
- code references help locate exactly where changes are needed
- the tool works with any public or private repo the user has access to
