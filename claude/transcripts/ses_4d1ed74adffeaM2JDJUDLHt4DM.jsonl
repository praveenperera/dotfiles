Overall assessment of the post's quality and effectiveness\n2. Strengths of the writing and technical explanations\n3. Areas for improvement in clarity, structure, or technical detail\n4. Suggestions for enhancing readability for both technical and less-technical audiences\n5. Any gaps in explanation or logical flow issues\n6. Specific recommendations for improvements with examples where applicable\n\nREQUIRED SKILLS:\n- Technical writing evaluation\n- Understanding of complex technical concepts (cryptography, authentication, mobile platforms)\n- Ability to assess both technical depth and accessibility\n- Document structure and flow analysis\n\nREQUIRED TOOLS:\n- read (to read the blog post file)\n\nMUST DO:\n- Read the entire blog post thoroughly\n- Evaluate the technical explanations for clarity and accuracy of presentation\n- Assess whether the progression from problem → existing solutions → proposed solution is effective\n- Check if the security considerations section adequately covers risks and mitigations\n- Evaluate whether code examples and data structures are well-explained\n- Consider the target audience (Bitcoin wallet developers, security researchers, technical users)\n- Provide specific, actionable feedback with examples\n- Note what works well in addition to areas for improvement\n- Consider the overall narrative flow and whether it builds understanding progressively\n\nMUST NOT DO:\n- Verify the technical correctness of cryptographic details (assume author's technical knowledge is sound)\n- Suggest major structural rewrites unless critically needed\n- Focus on minor grammar/style issues unless they impact clarity\n- Recommend adding content that would make the post significantly longer without clear benefit\n- Use tools beyond reading the file (no web searches, no external documentation lookups)\n\nCONTEXT:\nThis is a technical blog post proposing a new approach to Bitcoin wallet backup using WebAuthn PRF (Pseudo-Random Function) extension combined with cloud storage. The author (Praveen Perera) is building a Bitcoin wallet called Cove and is working with another developer (Tankred Hase) to formalize this into a specification. The post is meant to:\n1. Explain the problem with existing backup solutions\n2. Introduce the PRF-based architecture\n3. Provide enough technical detail for other wallet developers to understand and potentially implement\n4. Solicit feedback from the community before formalizing the spec\n\nThe post includes technical details like data structures (Rust code), encryption schemes, platform-specific considerations, and security tradeoffs. The target audience includes wallet developers, security researchers, and technically-minded Bitcoin users."}

We launched with the standard approach: show users their 12/24 words, tell them to write it down somewhere safe. But Cove is supposed to be beginner-friendly, and for users just getting started with a hot wallet, keeping those words secure and not losing them is a major source of anxiety.\n\nI've wanted to add automatic cloud backup for a while, but I hadn't found a solution I loved. After researching existing approaches and working through the tradeoffs, I designed an architecture using the WebAuthn PRF (Pseudo-Random Function) extension combined with untrusted cloud storage. PRF lets us derive an encryption key from a passkey, so we can store encrypted data in iCloud or Google Drive without having to trust Apple or Google. This post outlines a proposal for a universal backup mechanism that any wallet can implement.\n"}}
