# Workflow

- Ship production-quality changes. Model the domain first, make impossible states impossible with typed domain models, and prefer the proper owner or abstraction over caller-specific conditionals. Repeated fixes in one area signal that the model may be wrong; revisit it and remove shortcuts or resulting tech debt before finishing.

# General

- Only add important comments that explain why. Start inline comments lowercase and higher-level doc comments with a capital letter; do not end comments with periods or make them depend on conversation context. Document every public API in libraries.
- For commits, follow `$HOME/.agents/commit-message-guide.md`; use Praveen Perera when an author is needed, and never add AI co-authors or generated-by notes.
- Minimize nesting in functions.
- Do not leave deprecated code in place by default. Remove it, or ask whether the change must preserve the old path.
- Put ad hoc files the user may want to inspect, such as Markdown, HTML, screenshots, and image-generation outputs, in a repo-root `_scratch/` directory and create it if needed.
- In public-facing copy, include only reader-visible content. Omit implementation notes, workflow state, reasoning, conversation context, and edit instructions.
- Preserve unrelated user changes. Use hunk staging for commits and never undo unrelated edits.

# Rust

- In log and `println!` macros, prefer inline variable capture such as `warn!("person id={id} ...")` over positional placeholders.
- For unfamiliar crates or external libraries, inspect documentation or source instead of guessing. Check `target/doc/`, run `cargo doc -p <crate-name>`, inspect `~/.cargo/registry/src`, or use `btx` to look at the code directly.
- Fix clippy lints directly instead of silencing them. Run `cargo fix --allow-dirty` only when the working tree and command scope make it safe from unrelated changes.
- Prefer `eyre`, or `color-eyre` for CLIs, over `anyhow`.
- Use the Rust 2018+ module layout instead of `mod.rs` for regular modules.
- Use if-let chains with `&&` when they preserve semantics and reduce nesting.
- Avoid redundant closures; use `.map(func)` instead of `.map(|value| func(value))`.
- Prefer tuple structs for simple wrappers and structs with methods when they encapsulate shared state.
- Use named imports instead of wildcard imports.
- Keep test-only functions, types, and modules out of production code paths. Put them under `mod tests` or a dedicated `mod test_support`, and use `#[cfg(test)]` only to gate those modules.

# Verification

- After implementation changes, run the repository's formatter and linter. For Rust, run `just fmt` and `just clippy`; fall back to `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` when no justfile exists.

# Testing

- Add or update tests when they protect user-visible behavior, reproduce a bug, cover compatibility or migration risk, or lock down a non-obvious invariant.
- Do not add tests that only restate edited literals or implementation details.
- For static configuration or list changes, prefer compile or lint verification unless selection, fallback, parsing, migration, or filtering behavior needs coverage.
