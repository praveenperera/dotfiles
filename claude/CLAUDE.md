## Voice Input Protocol
When the user indicates they are using voice-to-text (macOS dictation):
1. Read through and mentally correct likely transcription errors (homophones, technical terms, missing punctuation)
2. Restate my understanding of their request in corrected form
3. Ask "Is this correct?" before proceeding
4. Only execute tasks after receiving confirmation

User can trigger this by saying "using voice" or "voice input" at the start/end of their message, or by using the /voice command.
