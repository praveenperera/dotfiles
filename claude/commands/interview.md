description: Deep interview for gathering requirements
argument-hint: [topic or feature]
---

Interview me in detail using the AskUserQuestionTool about $ARGUMENTS covering:
- Technical implementation details
- UI & UX considerations
- Concerns and edge cases
- Tradeoffs and alternatives

Ask non-obvious, in-depth questions. Continue interviewing until the topic is fully explored, then write the spec to the file.
