# titlecard-reveal — Title-Card / Single-Card Reveal

**intent**: The calm breather/landing beat — one clean title or single brand/proof card revealed with exactly one restrained move (a slide-up crossfade, or a wipe-away-to-reveal), then a still hold. Low motion is the payload, not a deficiency.

**roles served**

- Benefits (from `benefits-titlecard-crossfade`, #34): a calm two-line value title card — headline value line, then one slide-up crossfade to a qualifier/elaboration line that holds center.
- Social_Proof (from `social-proof-reveal-card`, #35): wipe a busy app-collage open away with one diagonal pill-sweep to reveal a clean brand lockup (icon + wordmark) plus a centered "loved by [N]+ [audience] teams" social-proof line that spring-settles and holds.

**duration**: 3–5s (Benefits 3–4s; Social_Proof ~5s / observed 4.7s).

**shot structure**

```
Scene 1 (0.0–~0.4s): static camera on [neutral / dark background]. Establish the opening state.
  Variant — Benefits: empty-to-text — [benefit line 1] is about to fade in centered (no busy open).
  Variant — Social_Proof: a busy intro frame holds briefly — an [app-screenshot / use-case collage] of overlapping cards under a [setup line].

Scene 2 (~0.4–~1.5s): the ONE move executes — a single restrained reveal that brings the calm card to center.
  Variant — Benefits: [benefit line 1] fades in centered while scaling slightly (~95%→100%, smooth ease-out) and holds.
  Variant — Social_Proof: a large [accent-color] rounded pill sweeps diagonally bottom-left → top-right and exits the corner, clip-path wiping the collage away to reveal the [brand logo lockup] beneath as the [logo icon] strokes draw on.

Scene 3 (~1.5s–end): the revealed/settled card holds to the end (the allocated stillness). At most one subtle live element (a slow breathing pulse on the card, or a very slow camera drift). No second development phase.
  Variant — Benefits: [benefit line 1] translates up and fades out as [benefit line 2 — qualifier / elaboration] translates up from below center and fades in to take center; holds. (This single slide-up crossfade IS the one move — Benefits front-loads no Scene-2 wipe.)
  Variant — Social_Proof: the lockup — [logo icon] centered, [wordmark] below, centered [social-proof tagline] "Loved by [N]+ [audience] teams" (the [N]+ may count up) — spring-settles small, then holds.
```

**motion vocabulary**: single restrained reveal (gentle fade-in + subtle scale-up settle | diagonal clip-path pill-wipe), one slide-up crossfade between two centered lines (Benefits), icon stroke draw-on (Social_Proof), optional "[N]+ teams" count-up, logo+tagline spring-settle-and-hold, subtle breathing on the held card, hold-to-end. Calm register — no spring chains, no tumble, no per-beat flips, no second phase. Camera static (optional very slow drift only).

**rule mapping**

- gentle fade-in + subtle scale-up settle (Benefits Scene 2) → `rules/scale-swap-transition.md` (restrained in/settle; cross-reference the fade ease in `techniques.md`)
- single slide-up crossfade between two centered lines (Benefits Scene 3) → `rules/discrete-text-sequence.md` (one line hands off to the next; translate-up + crossfade)
- diagonal pill-wipe reveal (Social_Proof Scene 2) → `rules/techniques.md` (clip-path reveal masks — the wipe)
- icon stroke draw-on (Social_Proof Scene 2) → `rules/svg-path-draw.md`
- "[N]+ teams" count-up (Social_Proof Scene 3, optional) → `rules/counting-dynamic-scale.md`
- logo + tagline spring-settle-and-hold (Social_Proof Scene 3) → `rules/spring-pop-entrance.md` (single soft settle; intentionally one beat, not a chain)
- subtle breathing on the held card (the one live element during the hold) → `rules/sine-wave-loop.md`

**camera modifier**: optional — a single very slow drift/push under the hold only → `rules/multi-phase-camera.md`. Default is fully static; do not add unless the held beat would otherwise read as a freeze-frame.

**stillness note**: This is a legitimate allocated-stillness beat. The hold in Scene 3 is the deliverable, not an unanimated gap — do NOT manufacture a development phase, extra swaps, or force-animation. One restrained move + a subtle hold (optionally one breathing element or one slow drift) is the correct and complete shape.
