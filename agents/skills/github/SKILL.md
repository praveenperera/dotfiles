# GitHub

## Overview

Use this skill as the umbrella entrypoint for general GitHub work. It should
decide whether the task stays in repository and PR triage or should be handed
off to a more specific review, CI, publish, or API workflow.

This workflow is intentionally hybrid:

- Prefer the GitHub app for repository, issue, pull request, comment, label,
  reaction, and PR creation workflows.
- Use local `git` and `gh` only when the connector does not cover the job well,
  especially for current-branch PR discovery, branch creation, commit and push,
  `gh auth status`, GitHub Actions log inspection, or raw API calls.
- Keep connector state and local checkout context aligned. If the request is
  about the current branch, resolve the local repo and branch before acting.

Once the intent is clear, route to the specialist skill immediately and do not
keep broad GitHub triage in scope longer than needed.

## Connector-First Responsibilities

Handle these directly in this skill when the request does not need a narrower
specialist workflow:

- repository orientation once the repo, PR, issue, or local checkout is
  identified
- recent PR or issue triage
- PR metadata summaries
- PR patch inspection
- PR comments, labels, and reactions
- issue lookup and summarization
- PR creation after a branch is already pushed

Prefer the GitHub app for those flows because it provides structured PR, issue,
and review-adjacent data without depending on a local checkout. If the
repository is not already identifiable from the user request or local git
context, ask for the repo instead of pretending there is a repo-search flow that
may not exist.

## CLI and API Responsibilities

Use `gh` subcommands when they cleanly support the operation. Use `gh api` when
GitHub only exposes the feature through the API or when `gh` does not have a
higher-level command.

- keep commands non-interactive
- verify auth with `gh auth status` before debugging API behavior
- when an API field must be numeric, boolean, or null, prefer `-F/--field` over
  `-f/--raw-field`

## Routing Rules

1. Resolve the operating context first:
   - If the user provides a repository, PR number, issue number, or URL, use
     that.
   - If the request is about "this branch" or "the current PR", resolve local
     git context and use `gh` only as needed to discover the branch PR.
   - If the repository is still ambiguous after local inspection, ask for the
     repo identifier.
2. Classify the request before taking action:
   - `repo or PR triage`: summarize PRs, issues, patches, comments, labels,
     reactions, or repository state
   - `review follow-up`: unresolved review threads, requested changes, or inline
     review feedback
   - `CI debugging`: failing checks, Actions logs, or CI root-cause analysis
   - `publish changes`: create or switch branches, stage changes, commit, push,
     and open a draft PR
   - `GitHub API`: raw REST or GraphQL operations through `gh api`
3. Route to the specialist skill as soon as the category is clear:
   - Review comments and requested changes:
     `../gh-address-comments/SKILL.md`
   - Failing GitHub Actions checks:
     `../gh-fix-ci/SKILL.md`
   - Commit, push, and open PR:
     `../yeet/SKILL.md`
   - Raw `gh` or `gh api` work:
     use the guides listed below
4. Keep the hybrid model consistent after routing:
   - connector first for PR and issue data
   - local `git`, `gh`, and `gh api` only for the specific gaps the connector
     does not cover

## Default Workflow

1. Resolve repository and item scope.
2. Gather structured PR or issue context through the GitHub app when useful.
3. Decide whether the task stays in connector-backed triage or needs a
   specialist skill.
4. Route immediately when the work becomes review follow-up, CI debugging,
   publish workflow, or raw API work.
5. End with a clear summary of what was inspected, what changed, and what
   remains.

## Output Expectations

- For triage requests, return a concise summary of the repository, PR, or issue
  state and the next likely action.
- For mixed requests, tell the user which specialist path you are taking and
  why.
- For connector-backed write actions, restate the exact PR, issue, label, or
  reaction target before applying the change.
- Never imply that GitHub Actions logs are available through the connector
  alone. That remains a `gh` workflow.

## Guides

- Link sub-issues to parent issues:
  [references/link-sub-issues.md](references/link-sub-issues.md)

## Examples

- "Use GitHub to summarize the open PRs in this repo and tell me what needs
  attention."
- "Help with this PR."
- "Review the latest comments on PR 482 and tell me what is actionable."
- "Debug the failing checks on this branch."
- "Commit these changes, push them, and open a draft PR."
