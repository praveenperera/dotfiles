# Story design — product launch video

Step 3 of the product-launch flow. Output: `STORYBOARD.md` (the narrative plan, one frame per beat) and `SCRIPT.md` (the locked spoken narration).

This step decides **what the video says, in what order, and how each beat is said** — and it says each beat in the SHAPE of a proven script. It does not design layout, composition, or motion (that is Step 4). For exact file syntax follow `../hyperframes-core/references/storyboard-format.md` and `../hyperframes-core/references/script-format.md`.

## What story design produces

For every beat, four things:

1. **Position in the SEQUENCE** — the shot order. Story truth decides which beats exist and in what order (the arc).
2. **Voiceover written in a blueprint's script shape** — the spoken line, drafted to sound like the proven script for the shape this beat is reaching toward (see the script bank below).
3. **A candidate `blueprint:` id** — the proven shot SHAPE this beat leans toward (a tag, not a commitment; Step 4 confirms or overrides).
4. **`transition_in`** — how this beat enters from the one before it.

The big idea: **the blueprint is applied from the very first step.** The blueprints were reverse-engineered from 50 golden clips; each one implies a proven script. So we write the VO in that script's shape from the start — the voiceover is blueprint-shaped before Step 4 ever runs, which makes the blueprint's hit-rate downstream high.

This is still a SOFT discipline. Story truth comes first: **never invent, bend, drop, or reorder a beat to fit a blueprint.** The script patterns only shape HOW a beat is said and which proven shape it leans toward — they never decide which beats exist.

## Read first

1. `hyperframes.json` — locked brief: angle, length, aspect ratio, language.
2. `frame.md` — tone, mood, design system, brand register.
3. `capture/extracted/visible-text.txt` — product facts, page copy, positioning, proof, CTA.
4. `capture/extracted/asset-descriptions.md` — the ONLY source for the captured asset inventory.
5. `user_script.txt` and `VO_MODE`, when present.

Do not inspect `capture/assets/`, contact sheets, screenshots, or raw files in Step 3. Treat `asset-descriptions.md` as the canonical asset list. Never invent asset filenames.

## Method

### 1. Extract the product truth

From the brief and captured text, name:

- **Audience** — who the video speaks to.
- **Pain / desire** — what they already want fixed or achieved.
- **Promise** — the one-line thesis of the whole video.
- **Product role** — what the product does in the story.
- **Proof** — features, UI moments, metrics, logos, demos.
- **CTA** — what the viewer should do next.

Build the sequence around the **promise**, not a feature list. A website is an information layout; a video is an emotional sequence. Reorder, merge, and omit captured content freely — do not follow page order.

### 2. Choose the arc (the sequence backbone)

Pick ONE arc — it fixes the beat order. Compound only when useful (e.g. `PAS with feature-benefit progression`).

| Arc                       | Use when                                         | Beat order                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PAS`                     | Pain is known and urgent (broken B2B workflows). | hook → pain → agitation → solution tease → product intro → proof/demo → CTA |
| `Future Pacing`           | Sells a new future / category / paradigm.        | imagine → name product → remove pain → mechanism → outcome → CTA            |
| `Demo Loop`               | UI is self-explanatory; best shown working.      | question → product intro → demo cycle 1 → demo cycle 2 → trust → CTA        |
| `BAB`                     | Bridges an old workflow to a better one.         | before → after tease → bridge/product → step 1 → step 2 → wow → CTA         |
| `Feature-Benefit Cascade` | Feature-rich or desire/status-driven.            | category hook → feature → benefit → feature → benefit → climax → CTA        |

Use feature→benefit rhythm inside any arc when there are many capabilities — always translate a feature into viewer value, never stack raw features.

`frame.md` tunes the VOICE, not the arc: restrained/B2B → plain, low-hype; bold/launch → short, punchy; warm/human → friendly direct address; premium/cinematic → aspirational, fewer words.

### 3. Lay out the beats, each with a role

One clear job per beat — never "more benefits" or "another feature." Beat `type` (= blueprint **role**):

`hook | pain_point | product_intro | feature_showcase | benefit_highlight | social_proof | branding | cta`

The opening 3–5s needs ONE hook that creates tension, curiosity, or desire — a shocking stat, pain validation, a rhetorical question, direct address, an imagine/future-pace, a category announcement, or visual spectacle. Never open with generic company description. Per `../hyperframes-creative/references/story-spine.md`: the hook speaks the viewer's outcome language (what they gain, never a feature list), and the promise (`message`) lands by beat 2 — features after that are its evidence.

A UI demo is usually a SEQUENCE of 3+ consecutive `feature_showcase` / `benefit_highlight` beats on the same surface (input → response → result → benefit), not one isolated frame.

### 4. Write each beat's VO in its blueprint's script shape

For each beat, look up its **role** in the script bank below, find the blueprint whose SHAPE fits the beat you already chose, and **draft the voiceover to sound like that blueprint's pattern.** Tag the candidate `blueprint:` id on the frame.

- The bank is the heart of this step: proven product-launch clips reversed into the one VO line each implies, grouped by role → blueprint, each with a **pattern** to imitate.
- If two blueprints fit the beat, prefer the one whose script shape matches the line you'd naturally write.
- If NO shape fits the beat, omit `blueprint:` and write the VO plainly — Step 4 composes that frame freely. Do not force a wrong shape.
- **Vary the shapes across the video.** Reaching for the same blueprint every beat re-creates the sameness this exists to avoid. `kinetic-type-beats` is the workhorse (6 roles) — lean on it, but not everywhere.
- **Write each VO as discrete cues, not one run-on breath.** Step 5 reveals each on-screen piece _when the voiceover names it_ (the anti-PowerPoint mechanism — `motion-language.md` Part 2). A line with clear phrase boundaries — "Content, sentiment, engagement — in one place" — hands the shot its reveal cadence for free; a single long clause leaves the frame nothing to pace to. The bank patterns are already cue-segmented — keep that rhythm.

Step 3 only TAGS the candidate id and writes the shaped VO. Step 4 (visual design) picks and instantiates the blueprint into a time-coded shot; it may override or drop a Step 3 candidate. The full menu with picking guidance lives in `../hyperframes-animation/blueprints-index.md`.

## The script bank — what each beat's VO sounds like

> Proven product-launch clips, each reversed into the one spoken line it implies. Grouped by **role → blueprint**. Real product names kept (swap in your own). Draft your beat's VO in the SHAPE of the matching pattern.

---

## VO_MODE handling

**No pasted script** — write the VO yourself, in the matching blueprint's script shape:

- 1–2 sentences per spoken beat, usually 6–20 words.
- Concrete and human; active verbs; say what the product does for a person.
- Avoid: "seamless experience," "unlock the power of," "streamline your workflow," long noun-phrase lists, a whole beat that is just "Or…".
- Silent beats are allowed when the visual proves the point — leave them out of `SCRIPT.md`.

**`VO_MODE = restructure`** — treat `user_script.txt` as source material. Rewrite, reorder, merge, or omit to fit the arc and target length. You may still shape each segment toward its beat's blueprint pattern.

**`VO_MODE = verbatim`** — do NOT change the user's words. Segment the script into beat-sized chunks at sentence/paragraph boundaries (split a long sentence only at a natural clause boundary). Final duration follows the provided script. Blueprint shaping does not apply to wording — only to which shape each verbatim chunk is paired with.

## Asset candidates

`asset_candidates` is the Step-3 → Step-4 handoff. Rules:

1. Read only `capture/extracted/asset-descriptions.md` to know what exists.
2. Use only filenames listed there; write as `assets/<basename>`.
3. One line, candidates separated by semicolons, a short description after `—`.
4. Prefer `[video]` assets when motion proves the product better than a still.
5. Use content assets (UI, screenshots, product photos, charts, demos). Skip tiny icons, favicons, badges, decorative chrome, repeated logo variants — unless the beat needs them. Partner / third-party logos come from `/media-use` (`resolve --type logo --entity <brand>`) — never redrawn by hand.
6. Pure-typography beats may use an empty asset list. Do not use nested lists.

Example:

```md
- asset_candidates: assets/dashboard-hero.png — dark analytics dashboard, wide screenshot; assets/demo-loop.mp4 — query-to-result interaction clip
```

## transition_in

Between-frame transition — how each frame ENTERS from the one before it. The harness's injector stamps it onto the two whole-frame clips (opacity / transform / filter on the frame wrappers). Name a **registry type** directly; optionally add a direction and/or a duration (`push-slide LEFT`, `crossfade 0.4s`). `cut` / `none` / empty = a hard cut.

The five registry types:

- **`crossfade`** — a plain opacity dissolve; the neutral choice when two frames sit in the same visual world.
- **`blur-crossfade`** — dissolve through a soft blur + slight scale; use when the two frames' backgrounds differ a lot, so the blur masks the color clash a plain crossfade would expose.
- **`push-slide`** `[LEFT|RIGHT|UP|DOWN]` — outgoing slides off, incoming pushes in from the opposite edge; a lateral "next beat" feel for a run of consecutive cards / feature beats.
- **`zoom-through`** — outgoing scales up + blurs out, incoming scales up from small into focus; for a STATE CHANGE / turning to a new section (hook → context).
- **`squeeze`** — outgoing compresses to a line on one edge as incoming expands from the other; a snappy, mechanical beat change.

Pick a small set and repeat them: default to `crossfade` (or `blur-crossfade` when the backgrounds clash), and reach for `zoom-through` at section boundaries. Frame 1's `transition_in` is a placeholder.

## Frame template

Use the exact fields required by the core storyboard format. The narrative shape each frame satisfies:

```md
## Frame N — Short name

- scene: one clear visual idea
- voiceover: "spoken line, written in the candidate blueprint's script shape, or empty"
- duration: rough estimate in seconds
- transition_in: crossfade
- status: outline
- src: compositions/frames/NN-short-name.html
- type: hook
- persuasion: Pain validation
- beat: urgency
- blueprint: kinetic-type-beats — candidate shape from the role→blueprint menu; omit when none fits
- asset_candidates: assets/example.png — short asset description

narrativeRole: what this beat does in the viewer journey.
keyMessage: the one idea the viewer should remember.
```

- `persuasion` — a concrete move (Pain agitation, Negative contrast, Friction reduction, Show-don't-tell proof, Feature-to-benefit translation, Statistical proof, Authority by association, Social proof, Risk reversal, Future pacing, Value stacking, Rule of three, Scarcity/urgency, Status seeking…). Never "show benefit." Invent one if none fits and explain it in the prose.
- `beat` — a specific emotion (anxiety, frustration, overwhelm, tension, urgency, skepticism, FOMO → relief, curiosity, clarity, intrigue, aspiration → trust, confidence, control, ease, power, awe, excitement, belonging → triumph, motivation, urgency-to-act, peace of mind, inevitability). Compound allowed (e.g. `relief + control`).

## Final checklist

- The arc is named; the sequence is narrative-driven, not page-order-driven.
- The opening uses one clear hook strategy that creates tension/curiosity/desire.
- Each beat has one job; every beat has `type`, `persuasion`, `beat`.
- Each beat's `voiceover` is written in its candidate blueprint's script shape (from the bank), with the candidate `blueprint:` tagged wherever a shape fits — and omitted where none does.
- Each `voiceover` is phrase-segmented into cues (each cue a piece Step 5 can reveal on) — not one long run-on clause.
- Shapes vary across the video; no single blueprint on every beat.
- Story truth was never bent to fit a blueprint — no beat invented/dropped/reordered for a shape.
- Every visual beat has suitable `asset_candidates` (filenames only from `asset-descriptions.md`), unless intentionally typography-only.
- UI/product demos use a multi-beat sequence when the value depends on workflow.
- `transition_in` is a registry type (`crossfade` / `blur-crossfade` / `push-slide` / `zoom-through` / `squeeze`) — default `crossfade` (`blur-crossfade` on a background clash), `zoom-through` at section boundaries, repeated across the video.
- `SCRIPT.md` contains only locked spoken narration; silent beats are intentional and omitted.
